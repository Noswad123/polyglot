# Polyglot
![Polyglot](./img/polyglot.png)

Polyglot helps developers learn programming concepts by comparing them across different languages and paradigms. Think of it as learning to communicate—not just memorize rules. As your communication skills evolve, so does your mastery.

Learn a programming language the way you’d learn to speak:
Start simple, practice often, and gradually embrace nuance and style.

Read more in the [Philosphy](#Philosophy) section.

## Contents
Each language in this repository includes the following sections:
- [Katas](./README/katas/index.md): Build fluency through hands-on excercises
- [Scripts](./README/scripts/index.md): Explore workflows and short real-world examples
- [Polyglot Frontend](./README/polyglot-frontend.md): UI implementation of Polyglot
- [Polyglot Backend](./README/polyglot-backend.md): API implementation of Polyglot
- [Playground](./README/playground.md): Experiment freely with concepts and language features

## How to Use This Repo
1. Pick a language you know—and one you’re learning.
2. Compare equivalent concepts across languages (variables, loops, functions, etc.).
3. Use Katas to strengthen intuition in each language.
4. Explore Scripts to see idiomatic patterns over time.
5. Study the Philosophy to understand how language and programming mirror each other.
6. Build your own examples once you have fluency.

Polyglot is not just a code repo—it’s a communication coach for programmers.
## Philosophy

Learning a programming language is like learning to communicate in a new tongue.
You don’t start with poetry or debate—you start with everyday conversation. As your fluency grows, so does your ability to express nuance, structure arguments, and craft elegant stories.

### Basic Fluency: Conversational Skills
    - In Language: Asking questions, stating facts, expressing needs, reading instructions.
    - In Programming: Variables, loops, functions, conditions; reading/writing files; handling basic errors.
    - Goal: comfort and clarity

### Intermediate: Style, Idioms, and Nuance
    - In Language: Idioms, slang, and finding your unique voice.
    - In Programming: Writing idiomatic code (“pythonic” in Python, etc.), discovering built-in functions, structuring solutions more elegantly.
    - Goal expressiveness

### Advanced: Rhetoric, Storytelling, and Philosophy
    - In Language: Rhetoric, persuasive writing, storytelling, and literary analysis.
    - In Programming: Software design, architecture, design patterns, coding paradigms, and principles like SOLID, DRY, and first principles thinking.
    - Goal: Intentional Design

## Programming concepts from a linguistic perspective
#### Coding Paradigms (Modes of discourse: narration, argumentation, exposition)
	- Paradigms define how you think and structure ideas.
	- Examples: Procedural, OOP, functional, declarative, event-driven.

    Purpose: Choose the style that makes your solution most natural.

#### Architectural Patterns (Structure of essays, news articles, debates)
	- High-level blueprints for organizing applications.
	- Examples: MVC, layered architecture, microservices.

    Purpose: Provide shape and flow—like a well-organized essay.

#### Design Patterns (Literary genres (poetry, essay), storytelling tropes (hero’s journey))
    - Reusable solutions to recurring problems.
    - Examples: Observer, Factory, Strategy, Singleton.

    Purpose: Shared vocabulary = faster, clearer collaboration.

#### Frameworks & Libraries(Idioms, proverbs, or quotations—using existing expressions for effect)
    - Tools built atop foundational patterns.
    - Examples: React, Django, Rails, Lodash, NumPy.

    Purpose: Say more with less—and build faster.

#### Clean Code & Refactoring (Editing for clarity, conciseness, and elegance)
    - Remove redundancy, improve structure, enhance readability.

    Purpose: Make your code a pleasure to revisit.

#### First Principles (Linguistics, grammar theory, logic, etymology)
    - Strip away tradition and ask: What am I really trying to do?

    Purpose: Encourage innovation and simplicity.
 
#### Testing & Test-Driven Development (Peer review, editing, feedback)
    - Validate assumptions, prevent regressions, build confidence.

#### Documentation (Writing instructions, essays, or reference materials)
    - Helps others understand your intent—and future-you will thank you.

#### Version Control (Revision history, drafts, and collaborative editing)
    - Track, revert, explore, and collaborate safely.

#### Code Reviews & Collaboration (Writing workshops, group projects)
    - Learn from others. Grow together. Catch mistakes early.

#### Performance Optimization (Editing for brevity, avoiding filler)
    - Remove unnecessary work; sharpen what matters.

#### Security & Privacy (Safe publishing, protecting sensitive information)
    - Ensure your code respects and protects users and systems.

## CLI Modes
Learn a concept in my languages
```sql
-- Get language id (if CLI doesn't hardcode it)
SELECT id FROM languages WHERE name = 'Python';

-- List all concepts available for that language
SELECT DISTINCT c.id, c.name, c.description
FROM concepts c
JOIN examples e ON e.concept_id = c.id
JOIN languages l ON l.id = e.language_id
WHERE l.name = 'Python'
ORDER BY c.name;

-- Get examples for one concept:
SELECT e.id, e.code_snippet, e.explanation
FROM examples e
JOIN languages l ON l.id = e.language_id
JOIN concepts c ON c.id = e.concept_id
WHERE l.name = 'Python'
  AND c.name = 'Loops';
```

Compare this concept across languages
polyglot compare --concept "loops" --with "Javascript, Go"
cli fetches examples for that concept in each language and prints them side-by-side or sequentially depending on screen real estate
```sql
SELECT l.name AS language,
       e.code_snippet,
       e.explanation
FROM examples e
JOIN languages l  ON l.id = e.language_id
JOIN concepts c   ON c.id = e.concept_id
WHERE c.name = 'Loops'
  AND l.name IN ('Python', 'JavaScript', 'Go')
ORDER BY l.name;
```

Give me the next thing to Study
``` sql
-- Given :language_trackable_id
SELECT t_concept.id, t_concept.name, p.status
FROM trackable_relationships r
JOIN trackables t_language ON t_language.id = r.source_id
JOIN trackables t_concept  ON t_concept.id = r.target_id
LEFT JOIN trackable_progress p ON p.trackable_id = t_concept.id
WHERE t_language.id = :language_trackable_id
  AND r.relation = 'uses'
  AND (p.status IS NULL OR p.status IN ('not started', 'in progress'))
ORDER BY COALESCE(p.status, 'not started') ASC, t_concept.name
LIMIT 1;
```

Quiz Me
```sql
SELECT e.id, c.name AS concept_name, e.code_snippet, e.explanation
FROM examples e
JOIN languages l ON l.id = e.language_id
JOIN concepts c ON c.id = e.concept_id
LEFT JOIN example_tags et ON et.example_id = e.id
LEFT JOIN tags t          ON t.id = et.tag_id
WHERE l.name = 'Python'
  AND (t.name = 'beginner' OR t.name IS NULL)
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 1;
```
