# Polyglot Backend

Every backend should have the behavior enumerated here

## Features

### Data Entry UI

#### sqlite database
    Concepts
    Trackables
    Languages
    Examples

##### SQL I want to remember for some reason
```sql
INSERT INTO tags (name) VALUES ('leetcode');
INSERT INTO trackable_tags (trackable_id, tag_id) VALUES (?, ?);
```

#### yaml file backup system

### Comparison Mode
- It would be interesting to implement polyglot using many languages
- What would it mean to implement?
