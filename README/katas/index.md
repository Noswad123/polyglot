# Katas
[home](../../README.md)

A kata is a focused coding challenge designed to improve problem-solving, fluency, and familiarity with programming concepts through deliberate, iterative practice. The idea here is to create a kata environment for any language of your choosing.

## Existing Katas
- [Boggle](./boggle.md)
- Bowling
- Fibonacci
- Poker

## Katas to add

### 📝 Everyday Practical Automations
    - Rename files in a folder to follow a pattern (e.g., Vacation-2025-01.jpg, Vacation-2025-02.jpg, etc.)
    - Make a to-do list app that saves tasks to a file and lets you check them off.
    - Track your expenses: Ask for a daily expense, save it, and show a summary for the week/month.
    - Remind yourself to take breaks: Pop up a message every hour.
    - Batch resize images in a folder (good if you take lots of photos).

### 💬 Fun with Text and Language
    - Random compliment generator (displays a new compliment every time you run it).
    - Simple chatbot that responds with funny answers to basic questions.
    - Word counter: Paste in text, and it counts words, sentences, or most-used words.
    - Mad Libs game: Asks for random words and inserts them into a silly story template.
    - Pig Latin translator: Converts English sentences to Pig Latin.

### 📂 File & Data Operations
    - Backup important files to a different folder or drive with a single command.
    - Find duplicate files (by name or content) in a directory.
    - Extract emails from a big block of text or from all text files in a folder.
    - Merge CSV files and summarize the results (e.g., total sales).

### 🌐 Web & API Fun
    - Weather checker: Ask for your city, fetch the weather from an API, and print a summary.
    - Quote of the day: Download and display an inspirational quote from a website.
    - Simple web scraper: Get the titles of the latest news articles from your favorite website.
    - Track the price of a product online and alert you if it drops.

🧮 Math, Games & Randomness
    - Roll a virtual die or coin flip (maybe keep a tally of results).
    - Number guessing game: Computer picks a number; you try to guess it.
    - Flashcards quiz: Test yourself on capitals, vocabulary, or trivia.
    - Password generator: Creates random passwords with rules you set.

📅 Time and Reminders
    - Countdown timer to an event (birthday, vacation, etc.).
    - Pomodoro timer: Helps you focus in 25-minute intervals, with breaks.
    - Daily journal prompt: Each day, save a different question and your answer.

🤖 “Power User” Utilities
    - Convert file formats: Like .txt to .csv, or images from .png to .jpg.
    - Monitor a folder for new files and alert you or process them.
    - Sync a folder to the cloud or an external drive automatically.

🦄 Just-for-Fun / Creative
    - ASCII art generator (turn text into stylized banners).
    - Random color picker: Shows a color and its hex/RGB code.
    - Meme caption generator: Add captions to images automatically.
    - Virtual pet: A silly script that asks you to “feed” or “play” with your pet each day.

### Assorted
    - Return a random value from a list
    - Read a list of numbers and print only the even ones.
    - Save some notes to a file so I don’t forget them.
    - Download the latest weather report and send me a notification.
    - Rename all the files in a folder to follow a consistent pattern.
    - Ask the user their name and greet them with it.
    - Convert a date from one format to another.
    - Show a random motivational quote each time I open a web page.
    - Running pointers
    - Linked List cycle or intersection detection
    - Divide and conquer or decrease and conquer
    - Recursive Problems that can be memoized or solved tabularly
    - Using FIFO and LIFO on onion layer problems
    - Binary search variations: left == right, left < right, left > right by 1 or more
    - counting or bucket sort
    - using min or max heap to find top k items
    - sliding, tumbling or fixed window
    - hash maps for quick lookups or duplicate detection
    - greedy algorithms
    - dealing with intervals
    - Dfs/Bfs serially or in parallel
    - Permutation and combination (repetitions and ordering using backtracking, loops or the choose vs. not choose strategy)
    - graph coloring
    - topological sort
    - shortest path variations
    - connected components
