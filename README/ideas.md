# Ideas
## CSV editing/viewing
   - For quick, ad-hoc checks or simple column extraction: cut, awk, grep.
   - For more structured filtering, pretty printing, or SQL-like queries: csvkit or q.
   - For interactive exploration and editing (like a spreadsheet in the terminal): visidata.
   - For recurring, complex operations or highly specific logic: Build your own CLI (Python is excellent for this).
