### Katas

A kata is a focused coding challenge designed to improve problem-solving, fluency, and familiarity with programming concepts through deliberate, iterative practice. The idea here is to create a kata environment for any language of your choosing.

#### Existing Katas
- Boggle
- Bowling
- Fibonacci
- Poker
- PrimeFactor
- Scrabble

#### Katas to add

Running pointers
Linked List cycle or intersection detection
Divide and conquer or decrease and conquer
Recursive Problems that can be memoized or solved tabularly
Using FIFO and LIFO on onion layer problems
Binary search variations: left == right, left < right, left > right by 1 or more
counting or bucket sort
using min or max heap to find top k items
sliding, tumbling or fixed window
hash maps for quick lookups or duplicate detection
greedy algorithms
dealing with intervals
Dfs/Bfs serially or in parallel
Permutation and combination (repetitions and ordering using backtracking, loops or the choose vs. not choose strategy)
graph coloring
topological sort
shortest path variations
connected components
